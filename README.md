ScalaProjectScript
==================

Bash Script for Creating Scala Projects

It's nothing special and not nearly as powerful/fully featured as, say, giter8, but it works perfectly for my needs.

Just `chmod +x` the `scala_project` file, alias it (if you wish), and run it and it will do the rest for you.
